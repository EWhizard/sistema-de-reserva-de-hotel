# sistema-de-reserva-de-hotel
A hotel reservation system implemented as a part of learning SDLC. 

Case Study
A Five star hotel decided to open up its reservation system for online booking. 
- Consider the following requirements
- Hotel has 700 rooms classified into multiple types ((Deluxe, Super Deluxe and Suite)
- Room tariff is based on the room type, season and day of the week (Weekday Vs. Weekend)
- Agents also can book rooms for their clients (Agent will be paid 1% commission for each booking)
- A room can be booked for a minimum of 1 night and maximum of 10 nights
- Multiple rooms can be booked by the same customer based on the number of guests accompanying
- Customers details will be maintained along with their preference for future reference and booking
- Advance payment (50%) is required to confirm a booking (can be paid thru payment gateway)
- Balance payment along with food and other service bill need to be paid at the time of check-out
- Cancellation of room (Partial days / full booking) is possible 3 days prior to check-in date. This should remove booking entries
